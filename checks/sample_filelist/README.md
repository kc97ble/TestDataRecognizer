# Sample Folder for checking `filelist.py`

This folder was structured to check the efficiency of `filelist.py`.

Apart from this file (`README.md`), any other files and folders from here are part of the checking process.

**Editing the structure of this folder must be parallel with editing `check_filelist.py`**
